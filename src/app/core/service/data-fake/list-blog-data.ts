        'description': "Pho likely evolved from similar noodle dishes. For example, villagers in Vân Cù say they ate pho long before the French colonial period. The modern form emerged between 1900 and 1907 in northern Vietnam, southeast of Hanoi in Nam Định Province, then a substantial textile market. The traditional home of pho is reputed to be the villages of Vân Cù and Dao Cù (or Giao Cù) in Đông Xuân commune, Nam Trực District, Nam Định Province. Cultural historian and researcher Trịnh Quang Dũng believes that the popularization and origins of modern pho stemmed from the intersection of several historical and cultural factors in the early 20th century. These include improved availability of beef due to French demand, which in turn produced beef bones that were purchased by Chinese workers to make into a dish similar to pho called ngưu nhục phấn. The demand for this dish was initially the greatest with workers from the provinces of Yunnan and Guangdong, who had an affinity for the dish due to its similarities to that of their homeland, which eventually popularized and familiarized this dish with the general population. Pho was originally sold at dawn and dusk by itinerant street vendors, who shouldered mobile kitchens on carrying poles (gánh phở). From the pole hung two wooden cabinets, one housing a cauldron over a wood fire, the other storing noodles, spices, cookware, and space to prepare a bowl of pho. The heavy gánh was always shouldered by men. They kept their heads warm with distinctive, disheveled felt hats called mũ phở. Hanoi's first two fixed pho stands were a Vietnamese-owned Cát Tường on Cầu Gỗ Street and a Chinese-owned stand in front of Bờ Hồ tram stop. They were joined in 1918 by two more on Quạt Row and Đồng Row. Around 1925, a Vân Cù villager named Vạn opened the first 'Nam Định style' pho stand in Hanoi. Gánh phở declined in number around 1936–1946 in favor of stationary eateries."

        'description': 'The wok is smoking even before Adam Cliff adds oil. The chef and owner of the popular Thai restaurant Samsen, in Hong Kong’s Wan Chai district, is showing how he makes pad Thai. The key is a hot wok to prevent the ingredients from sticking, he says, but it’s important to control the temperature throughout the cooking process, because tamarind and palm sugar, for example, can scorch easily. First, cubes of hard, dried tofu sizzle in the hot oil briefly before the chef adds radish, dried shrimps and shallots. The flavours are already melding before Cliff tosses in large, fresh tiger prawns. He shunts the mixture to the side of the wok then fries an egg in the flavourful oil at its base, before blending it with the other ingredients. Dried rice noodles, along with peanuts, garlic, chives and bean sprouts, add another layer of flavour and texture. To finish the dish off, a combination of tamarind paste, palm sugar and fish sauce is poured in. Within minutes it is ready to serve.'

        'description': 'The origin stories place the birth of Japanese ramen anywhere between the 17th and 20th centuries. Early attempts to establish a history of ramen claim a scholar named Shu Shunsui brought the recipe with him when he escaped Manchu rule in China to serve as an advisor to feudal lord Tokugawa Mitsukuni. While the narrative reflects China’s enormous cultural influence on Japan at the time, there’s just one problem with it: No historical record of Shunsui actually cooking ramen for Mitsukuni exists. A more plausible theory, Solt told his audience, dates Japanese ramen consumption to the founding of Rai-Rai Ken in Tokyo (not to be confused with the shop of the same name in New York’s East Village) by a customs agent who’d worked in Yokohama’s Chinatown. Opening its doors in 1910, the restaurant employed Chinese cooks and popularized what was then known as “shina soba”: shina for China, soba for the noodle dish already well established in Japanese cuisine. Here’s where the history of ramen gets “touchy,” to put it charitably. Shina soba caught on with blue-collar workers because it was cheap and filling—major bonuses for diners without much time or money. But shina soba wasn’t just associated with cost-cutting; it was also linked to China, a country defeated and conquered by Japan just as the dish caught on. Take Nankin Senryo, the ramen shop founded in 1937, the same year as Japan’s invasion of Nanjing. Its name translates literally to “flower,” but it’s also a homonym for “occupation.” Laborers weren’t the only ones who took a liking to shina soba. Politically radical students and soldiers did as well.'

        'description': 'Udon (饂飩, usually written as うどん) is a type of thick, wheat-flour noodle used frequently in Japanese cuisine. It is often served hot as a noodle soup in its simplest form, as kake udon, in a mildly flavoured broth called kakejiru, which is made of dashi, soy sauce, and mirin. It is usually topped with thinly chopped scallions. Other common toppings include tempura, often prawn or kakiage (a type of mixed tempura fritter), or aburaage, a type of deep-fried tofu pockets seasoned with sugar, mirin, and soy sauce. A thin slice of kamaboko, a halfmoon-shaped fish cake, is often added. Shichimi can be added to taste. The flavour of broth and topping vary from region to region. Usually, dark brown broth, made from dark soy sauce (koikuchi shōyu), is used in eastern Japan, and light brown broth, made from light soy sauce (usukuchi shōyu), is used in western Japan. This is noticeable in packaged instant noodles, which are often sold in two different versions for east and west. Currynanban is another popular variation, served in curry broth.'
